# CodeKidsPlatformer
Platform game made to be editable by u10's to teach kids code and game making 

WIP - so not much to say here yet, plan is to add easily editable components,
teach a basic transition from Scratch style code blocks over to real code 
by editing Lua and C# scripts, and developing design skills with basic sprite
animation and adding sound, as well as a level editor.
